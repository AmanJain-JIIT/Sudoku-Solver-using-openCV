# Sudoku-Solver-using-openCV
This project was made using the concepts of Computer Vision and python's openCV library. This application has the capability to extract the sudoku grid from any image uploaded and overlay the solution of that sudoku puzzle on that image.

Concepts Used :
1. Computer Vision
2. Deep Learning
3. Neural Networks
4. Backtracking
5. openCV

Major Libraries and Frameworks used :
1. TensorFlow
2. Keras
3. openCV
4. numpy
5. PIL
6. matplotlib
7. tkinter

Methodology :
1. A digit prediction model was prepared by training the mnist dataset using the convolutional neural networks.(accuracy : 99.2%)
2. Sudoku puzzle was extracted from the uploaded image by using thresholding and contours on the image.(openCV)
3. The extracted puzzle image was converted to a 2-D array to fit the sudoku solveing function.(by splitting image into 81 cells)
4. A sudoku solving functions was prepared using the concept of backtracking.
5. The solution generated by the function was overlayed on the original image.(using openCV)
6. Everything was compiled and the application's UI was designed using python's Tkinter library.
